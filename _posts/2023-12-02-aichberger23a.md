title: 'ELENAS: Elementary Neural Architecture Search'
openreview: 1tZY0La5GFRp
abstract: Deep neural networks typically rely on a few key building blocks such as
  feed-forward, convolution, recurrent, long short-term memory, or attention blocks.
  On an elementary level, these blocks consist of a relatively small number of different
  mathematical operations. However, as the number of all combinations of these operations
  is immense, crafting such novel building blocks requires profound expert knowledge
  and is far from being fully explored. We propose Elementary Neural Architecture
  Search (ELENAS), a method that learns to combine elementary mathematical operations
  to form new building blocks for deep neural networks. These building blocks are
  represented as computational graphs, which are processed by graph neural networks
  as part of a reinforcement learning system. Our approach contrasts the current research
  direction of Neural Architecture Search, which mainly focuses on designing neural
  networks by altering and combining a few, already established, building blocks.
  In a set of experiments, we demonstrate that our method leads to efficient building
  blocks that achieve strong generalization and transfer well to real-world data.
  When stacked together, they approach and even outperform state-of-the-art neural
  networks at several prediction tasks. Our underlying methodological framework offers
  high flexibility and broad applicability across domains while requiring relatively
  small computational costs. Consequently, it has the potential to find novel building
  blocks that become of general importance for machine learning practitioners beyond
  specific data or use cases.
