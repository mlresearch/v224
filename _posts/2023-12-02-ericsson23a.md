title: Better Practices for Domain Adaptation
openreview: tQz8u2KU3zy
abstract: 'Distribution shifts are all too common in real-world applications of machine
  learning. Domain adaptation (DA) aims to address this by providing various frameworks
  for adapting models to the deployment data without using labels. However, the domain
  shift scenario raises a second more subtle challenge: the difficulty of performing
  hyperparameter optimisation (HPO) for these adaptation algorithms without access
  to a labelled validation set. The unclear validation protocol for DA has led to
  bad practices in the literature, such as performing HPO using the target test labels
  when, in real-world scenarios, they are not available. This has resulted in over-optimism
  about DA research progress compared to reality. In this paper, we analyse the state
  of DA when using good evaluation practice, by benchmarking a suite of candidate
  validation criteria and using them to assess popular adaptation algorithms. We show
  that there are challenges across all three branches of domain adaptation methodology
  including Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA),
  and Test Time Adaptation (TTA). While the results show that realistically achievable
  performance is often worse than expected, they also show that using proper validation
  splits is beneficial, as well as showing that some previously unexplored validation
  metrics provide the best options to date. Altogether, our improved practices covering
  data, training, validation and hyperparameter optimisation form a new rigorous pipeline
  to improve benchmarking, and hence research progress, within this important field
  going forward.'
