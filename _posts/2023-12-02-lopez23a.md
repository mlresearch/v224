title: 'AlphaD3M: An Open-Source AutoML Library for Multiple ML Tasks'
openreview: 71eJdMzCCIi
abstract: We present AlphaD3M, an open-source Python library that supports a wide
  range of machine learning tasks over different data types. We discuss the challenges
  involved in supporting multiple tasks and how AlphaD3M addresses them by combining
  deep reinforcement learning and meta-learning to effectively construct pipelines
  over a large collection of primitives. To better integrate the use of AutoML within
  the data science lifecycle, we have built an ecosystem of tools around AlphaD3M
  that support user-in-the loop tasks, including the selection of suitable pipelines
  and the development of solutions for complex systems. We present use cases that
  demonstrate some of these features. We report the results of detailed experimental
  evaluations which show that AlphaD3M is effective and derives high-quality pipelines
  for a diverse set of problems with performance that is comparable or superior to
  state-of-the-art AutoML systems.
