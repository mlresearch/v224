title: 'OFA$^3$: Automatic selection of the best non-dominated sub-networks for ensembles'
openreview: 0yj3LL-0KcX
abstract: 'Advancement of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has the potential to significantly
  improve the efficiency and performance of machine learning systems, as well as enable
  the exploration of new architectures and applications across a wide range of fields,
  including computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, robotics,
  and more. A promising direction for developing more scalable and adaptive neural
  network architectures is the Once-for-All (OFA), a NAS framework that decouples
  the training and the search stages, meaning that one super-network is trained once,
  and then multiple searches can be performed according to different deployment scenarios.
  More recently, the OFA$^2$ strategy improved the search stage of the OFA framework
  by exploring the multi-objective nature of the problem: a set of non-dominated sub-networks
  are all obtained at once, with distinct trade-offs involving hardware constraints
  and accuracy. In this work, we further improve the search stage of the OFA$^2$ by
  fine-tuning the non-dominated solutions. Furthermore, we propose OFA$^3$, building
  high-performance ensembles by solving the problem of how to automatically select
  the optimal subset of the already obtained non-dominated sub-networks. Particularly
  when components of the ensemble can run in parallel, our results dominate any other
  configuration of the available sub-networks, taking accuracy and latency as the
  conflicting objectives.'
