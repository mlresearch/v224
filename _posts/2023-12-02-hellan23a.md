title: 'Obeying the Order: Introducing Ordered Transfer Hyperparameter Optimisation'
openreview: zaBJZmaSOf7
abstract: We introduce ordered transfer hyperparameter optimisation (OTHPO), a version
  of transfer learning for hyperparameter optimisation (HPO) where the tasks follow
  a sequential order. Unlike for state-of-the-art transfer HPO, the assumption is
  that each task is most correlated to those immediately before it. This matches many
  deployed settings, where hyperparameters are retuned as more data is collected;
  for instance tuning a sequence of movie recommendation systems as more movies and
  ratings are added. We propose a formal definition, outline the differences to related
  problems and propose a basic OTHPO method that outperforms state-of-the-art transfer
  HPO. We empirically show the importance of taking order into account using ten benchmarks.
  The benchmarks are in the setting of gradually accumulating data, and span XGBoost,
  random forest, approximate k-nearest neighbor, elastic net, support vector machines
  and a separate real-world motivated optimisation problem. We open source the benchmarks
  to foster future research on ordered transfer HPO.
