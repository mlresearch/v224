title: Neural Architecture Search for Visual Anomaly Segmentation
openreview: O0XkkITcLJKu
abstract: 'This paper presents the first application of neural architecture search
  to the complex task of segmenting visual anomalies. Measurement of anomaly segmentation
  performance is challenging due to imbalanced anomaly pixels, varying region areas,
  and various types of anomalies. First, the region-weighted Average Precision (rwAP)
  metric is proposed as an alternative to existing metrics, which does not need to
  be limited to a specific maximum false positive rate. Second, the AutoPatch neural
  architecture search method is proposed, which enables efficient segmentation of
  visual anomalies without any training. By leveraging a pre-trained supernet, a black-box
  optimization algorithm can directly minimize computational complexity and maximize
  performance on a small validation set of anomalous examples. Finally, compelling
  results are presented on the widely studied MVTec dataset, demonstrating that AutoPatch
  outperforms the current state-of-the-art with lower computational complexity, using
  only one example per type of anomaly. The results highlight the potential of automated
  machine learning to optimize throughput in industrial quality control. The code
  for AutoPatch is available at: \url{https://github.com/tommiekerssies/AutoPatch}.'
