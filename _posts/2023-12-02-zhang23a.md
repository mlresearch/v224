title: 'Class-attribute Priors: Adapting Optimization to Heterogeneity and Fairness
  Objective'
openreview: 9ZE9L4tzO7D
abstract: 'Modern classification problems exhibit heterogeneities across individual
  classes: Each class may have unique attributes, such as sample size, label quality,
  or predictability (easy vs difficult), and variable importance at test-time. Without
  care, these heterogeneities impede the learning process, most notably, when optimizing
  fairness objectives. We propose an effective and general method to personalize the
  optimization strategy of individual classes so that optimization better adapts to
  heterogeneities. Concretely, class-attribute priors (CAP) is a meta-strategy which
  proposes a class-specific strategy based on its attributes. This meta approach leads
  to substantial improvements over naive approach of assigning separate hyperparameters
  for each class. We instantiate CAP for loss function design and posthoc logit adjustment,
  with an emphasis on label-imbalanced problems. We show that CAP is competitive with
  prior art and its flexibility unlocks noticeable improvements for fairness objectives
  beyond balanced accuracy. Finally, we evaluate CAP on problems with label noise
  as well as weighted test objectives to showcase how CAP can synergistically leverage
  different class attributes.'
