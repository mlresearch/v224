title: 'Meta-Learning for Fast Model Recommendation in Unsupervised Multivariate Time
  Series Anomaly Detection '
openreview: 7cUV9K3ns9Q
abstract: 'Unsupervised model recommendation for anomaly detection is a recent discipline
  for which there is no existing work that focuses on multivariate time series data.
  This paper studies that problem under real-world restrictions, most notably: (i)
  a limited time to issue a recommendation, which renders existing methods based around
  the testing of a large pool of models unusable;  (ii) the need for generalization
  to previously unseen data sources, which is seldom factored in the experimental
  evaluation.  We turn to meta-learning and propose Hydra, the first meta-recommender
  for anomaly detection in literature that we especially analyze in the context of
  multivariate times series. We conduct our experiments using 94  public datasets
  from 4 different data sources. Our ablation study testifies that our meta-recommender
  achieves a higher performance than the current state of the art, including in difficult
  scenarios in which data similarity is minimal: our proposal is able to recommend
  a model in the top 10% (13%) of the algorithmic pool for known (unseen) sources
  of data.'
