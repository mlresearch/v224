title: Adaptive Regularization for Class-Incremental Learning
openreview: HRiwg7ssO7c
abstract: Class-Incremental Learning updates a deep classifier with new categories
  while maintaining the previously observed class accuracy. Regularizing the neural
  network weights is a common method to prevent forgetting previously learned classes
  while learning novel ones. However, existing regularizers use a constant magnitude
  throughout the learning sessions, which may not reflect the varying levels of difficulty
  of the tasks encountered during incremental learning. This study investigates the
  necessity of adaptive regularization in Class-Incremental Learning, which dynamically
  adjusts the regularization strength according to the complexity of the task at hand.
  We propose a Bayesian Optimization-based approach to automatically determine the
  optimal regularization magnitude for each learning task. Our experiments on two
  datasets via two regularizers demonstrate the importance of adaptive regularization
  for achieving accurate and less forgetful visual incremental learning.
