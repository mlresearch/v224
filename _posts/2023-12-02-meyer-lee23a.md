title: On the selection of neural architectures from a supernet
openreview: XM_v85teqN
abstract: After DARTS provided a method utilizing a supernet to search for neural
  network architectures entirely through gradient descent, differentiable supernet-based
  methods emerged as a powerful and popular approach to efficient neural architecture
  search (NAS). Following works improved upon many aspects of the DARTS algorithm
  but generally kept the original method of selecting the final architecture, pruning
  the lowest magnitude architecture weights. though critiques of this approach have
  led to alternative architecture selection mechanisms, such as a perturbation-based
  method. Here we perform a broad comparative evaluation of architecture selection
  methods in combination with different techniques for training the supernet, and
  highlight the interdependence between various methods for supernet training and
  architecture selection mechanisms.  We show the potential for improved results for
  many NAS supernet training methods via alternate architecture selection mechanisms
  relative to the pruning-based architecture selection they were introduced, and are
  typically evaluated, with. In evaluating architecture selection methods, we also
  demonstrate how zero-shot NAS methods may be effectively integrated into supernet
  NAS training as new architecture selection mechanisms.
