title: Learning Activation Functions for Sparse Neural Networks
openreview: 3dpOZ2dZcAa
abstract: 'Sparse Neural Networks (SNNs) can potentially demonstrate similar performance
  to their dense counterparts while saving significant energy and memory at inference.
  However, the accuracy drop incurred by SNNs, especially at high pruning ratios,
  can be an issue in  critical deployment conditions. While recent works mitigate
  this issue through sophisticated pruning techniques, we shift our focus to an overlooked
  factor: hyperparameters and activation functions. Our analyses have shown that the
  accuracy drop can additionally be attributed to (i) Using ReLU as the default choice
  for activation functions unanimously, and (ii) Fine-tuning SNNs with the same hyperparameters
  as dense counterparts. Thus, we focus on learning a novel way to tune activation
  functions for sparse networks and combining these with a separate hyperparameter
  optimization (HPO) regime for sparse networks. By conducting experiments on popular
  DNN models (LeNet-5, VGG-16, ResNet-18, and EfficientNet-B0) trained on MNIST, CIFAR-10,
  and ImageNet-16 datasets, we show that the novel combination of these two approaches,
  dubbed Sparse Activation Function Search, short: SAFS, results in up to 15.53%,
  8.88%, and 6.33% absolute improvement in the accuracy for  LeNet-5, VGG-16, and
  ResNet-18 over the default training protocols, especially at high pruning ratios.'
