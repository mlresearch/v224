title: Poisson Process for Bayesian Optimization
openreview: A9FUg5vrw7Y6
abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a sample-efficient black-box optimizer, and
  extensive methods have been proposed to build the absolute function response of
  the black-box function through a probabilistic surrogate model, including Tree-structured
  Parzen Estimator (TPE), Sequential Model Algorithm Configuration (SMAC), and Gaussian
  process (GP). However, few methods have been explored to estimate the relative rankings
  of candidates, which can be more robust to noise and have better practicality than
  absolute function responses, especially when the function responses are intractable
  but preferences can be acquired. To this end, we propose a novel ranking-based surrogate
  model based on the Poisson process and introduce an efficient BO framework, namely
  Poisson Process Bayesian Optimization (PoPBO). Two tailored acquisition functions
  are further derived from classic LCB and EI to accommodate it. Compared to the classic
  GP-BO method, our PoPBO has lower computation costs and better robustness to noise,
  which is verified by abundant experiments. The results on both simulated and real-world
  benchmarks, including hyperparameter optimization (HPO) and neural architecture
  search (NAS), show the effectiveness of PoPBO.
