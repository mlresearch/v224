title: 'Differentiable Architecture Search: a One-Shot Method?'
openreview: LV-5kHj-uV5
abstract: 'Differentiable architecture search (DAS) is a widely researched tool for
  the design of novel architectures. The main benefit of DAS is the effectiveness
  achieved through the weight-sharing one-shot paradigm, which allows efficient architecture
  search. In this work, we investigate DAS in a systematic case study of inverse problems,
  which allows us to analyze these potential benefits in a controlled manner.  We
  demonstrate that the success of DAS can be extended from image classification to
  signal reconstruction, in principle. However, our experiments also expose three
  fundamental difficulties in the evaluation of DAS-based methods in inverse problems:
  First, the results show a large variance in all test cases. Second, the final performance
  is strongly dependent on the hyperparameters of the optimizer. And third, the performance
  of the weight-sharing architecture used during training does not reflect the final
  performance of the found architecture well. While the results on image reconstruction
  confirm the potential of the DAS paradigm, they challenge the common understanding
  of DAS as a one-shot method.'
