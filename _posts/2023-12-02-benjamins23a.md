title: Self-Adjusting Weighted Expected Improvement for Bayesian Optimization
openreview: ydqqogDD5RW
abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a class of surrogate-based, sample-efficient
  algorithms for optimizing black-box problems with small evaluation budgets. The
  BO pipeline itself is highly configurable with many different design choices regarding
  the initial design, surrogate model, and acquisition function (AF). Unfortunately,
  our understanding of how to select suitable components for a problem at hand is
  very limited. In this work, we focus on the definition of the AF, whose main purpose
  is to balance the trade-off between exploring regions with high uncertainty and
  those with high promise for good solutions. We propose Self-Adjusting Weighted Expected
  Improvement (SAWEI), where we let the exploration-exploitation trade-off self-adjust
  in a data-driven manner, based on a convergence criterion for BO. On the noise-free
  black-box BBOB functions of the COCO benchmarking platform, our method exhibits
  a favorable any-time performance compared to handcrafted baselines and serves as
  a robust default choice for any problem structure. The suitability of our method
  also transfers to HPOBench. With SAWEI, we are a step closer to on-the-fly, data-driven,
  and robust BO designs that automatically adjust their sampling behavior to the problem
  at hand.
