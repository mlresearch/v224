title: 'Q(D)O-ES: Population-based Quality (Diversity) Optimisation for Post Hoc Ensemble
  Selection in AutoML'
openreview: zvV7hemQmtLl
abstract: Automated machine learning (AutoML) systems commonly ensemble models post
  hoc to improve predictive performance, typically via greedy ensemble selection (GES).
  However, we believe that GES may not always be optimal, as it performs a simple
  deterministic greedy search. In this work, we introduce two novel population-based
  ensemble selection methods, QO-ES and QDO-ES, and compare them to GES. While QO-ES
  optimises solely for predictive performance, QDO-ES also considers the diversity
  of ensembles within the population, maintaining a diverse set of well-performing
  ensembles during optimisation based on ideas of quality diversity optimisation.
  The methods are evaluated using 71 classification datasets from the AutoML benchmark,
  demonstrating that QO-ES and QDO-ES often outrank GES, albeit only statistically
  significant on validation data. Our results further suggest that diversity can be
  beneficial for post hoc ensembling but also increases the risk of overfitting.
