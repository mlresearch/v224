title: Symbolic Explanations for Hyperparameter Optimization
openreview: JQwAc91sg_x
abstract: 'Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) methods can determine well-performing
  hyperparameter configurations efficiently but often lack insights and transparency.
  We propose to apply symbolic regression to meta-data collected with Bayesian optimization
  (BO) during HPO. In contrast to prior approaches explaining the effects of hyperparameters
  on model performance, symbolic regression allows for obtaining explicit formulas
  quantifying the relation between hyperparameter values and model performance. Overall,
  our approach aims to make the HPO process more explainable and human-centered, addressing
  the needs of multiple user groups: First, providing insights into the HPO process
  can support data scientists and machine learning practitioners in their decisions
  when using and interacting with HPO tools. Second, obtaining explicit formulas and
  inspecting their properties could help researchers understand the HPO loss landscape
  better. In an experimental evaluation, we find that naively applying symbolic regression
  directly to meta-data collected during HPO is affected by the sampling bias introduced
  by BO. However, the true underlying loss landscape can be approximated by fitting
  the symbolic regression on the surrogate model trained during BO. By penalizing
  longer formulas, symbolic regression furthermore allows the user to decide how to
  balance the accuracy and explainability of the resulting formulas.'
