title: Oversampling to Repair Bias and Imbalance Simultaneously
openreview: CF7FzuUkUck
abstract: Both group bias and class imbalance occur when instances with certain characteristics
  are under-represented in the data.  Group bias causes estimators to be unfair and
  class imbalance causes estimators to be inaccurate.  Oversampling ought to address
  both kinds of under-representation.  Unfortunately, it is hard to pick a level of
  oversampling that yields the best fairness and accuracy for a given estimator.  This
  paper introduces Orbis, an oversampling algorithm that can be precisely tuned for
  both fairness and accuracy.  Orbis is a pre-estimator bias mitigator that modifies
  the data used to train downstream estimators.  This paper demonstrates how to use
  automated machine learning to tune Orbis along with the choice of estimator that
  follows it and empirically compares various approaches for blending multiple metrics
  into a single optimizer objective.  Overall, this paper introduces a new bias mitigator
  along with a methodology for training and tuning it.
