title: 'forester: A Novel Approach to Accessible and Interpretable AutoML for Tree-Based
  Modeling'
openreview: Q3DWpGoX7PD
abstract: The majority of AutoML solutions are developed in Python. However, a large
  percentage of data scientists are associated with the R language. Unfortunately,
  there are limited R solutions available with high entry level which means they are
  not accessible to everyone. To fill this gap, we present the \emph{forester} package,
  which offers ease of use regardless of the user’s proficiency in the area of machine
  learning.  The \emph{forester} package is an open-source AutoML package implemented
  in R designed for training high-quality tree-based models on tabular data. It supports
  regression and binary classification tasks. A single line of code allows the use
  of unprocessed datasets, informs about potential issues concerning them, and handles
  feature engineering automatically. Moreover, hyperparameter tuning is performed
  by Bayesian optimization, which provides high-quality outcomes. The results are
  later served as a ranked list of models. Finally, the \emph{forester} package offers
  a vast training report, including the ranked list, a comparison of trained models,
  and explanations for the best one.
