title: 'AutoGluon–TimeSeries: AutoML for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting'
openreview: XHIY3cQ8Tew
abstract: We introduce AutoGluon–TimeSeries—an open-source AutoML library for probabilistic
  time series forecasting. Focused on ease of use and robustness, AutoGluon-TimeSeries
  enables users to generate accurate point and quantile forecasts with just 3 lines
  of Python code. Built on the design philosophy of AutoGluon, AutoGluon–TimeSeries
  leverages ensembles of diverse forecasting models to deliver high accuracy within
  a short training time. AutoGluon–TimeSeries combines both conventional statistical
  models, machine-learning based forecasting approaches, and ensembling techniques.
  In our evaluation on 29 benchmark datasets, AutoGluon–TimeSeries demonstrates strong
  empirical performance, outperforming a range of forecasting methods in terms of
  both point and quantile forecast accuracy, and often even improving upon the best-in-hindsight
  combination of prior methods.
