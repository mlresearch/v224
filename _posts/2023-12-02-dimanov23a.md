title: MEOW - Multi-Objective Evolutionary Weapon Detection
openreview: Eyzx7rDo-JNh
abstract: 'X-ray screening is crucial for ensuring safety and security in crowded
  public areas. However, X-ray operators are often overwhelmed by the sheer amount
  of potential threats to assess; thus, current computer vision-aided systems are
  designed to alleviate these workloads. In this study, we focus on a key, unresolved
  challenge for developing such automatic X-ray screening systems: the direct application
  of existing avant garde computer vision approaches does not necessarily yield satisfactory
  results in the X-ray medium, hindering the effectiveness of current screening systems.
  To overcome this drawback, we propose a novel automated machine learning (AutoML)
  multi-objective approach for neural architecture search (NAS) for concealed weapon
  detection (MEOW). We benchmark MEOW with the state-of-the-art in two comprehensive
  scenarios in threat identification: SIXray (a popular, massive X-ray dataset) and
  Residuals (a proprietary, unpublished dataset provided by our industry partners).
  MEOW consist of the coalescence of two new components: First, we design a heuristic
  technique to strongly reduce the high computational cost of neuroevolutionary search
  while preserving a high performance such that it can be effectively used in real-time
  industrial settings. Second, we devise a novel ensemble approach for combining multiple
  discovered architectures simultaneously. Leveraging these two characteristics, MEOW
  outperforms the state-of-the-art while keeping the NAS overhead to a minimum. More
  broadly, our results suggest that AutoML has a strong potential for security applications.'
