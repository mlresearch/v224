title: Searching for Fairer Machine Learning Ensembles
openreview: 7Nbd1Ru1M_t
abstract: Bias mitigators can improve algorithmic fairness in machine learning models,
  but their effect on fairness is often not stable across data splits.  A popular
  approach to train more stable models is ensemble learning, but unfortunately, it
  is unclear how to combine ensembles with mitigators to best navigate trade-offs
  between fairness and predictive performance.  To that end, we extended the open-source
  library Lale to enable the modular composition of 8 mitigators, 4 ensembles, and
  their corresponding hyperparameters, and we empirically explored the space of configurations
  on 13 datasets.  We distilled our insights from this exploration in the form of
  a guidance diagram that can serve as a starting point for practitioners that we
  demonstrate is robust and reproducible.  We also ran automatic combined algorithm
  selection and hyperparmeter tuning (or CASH) over ensembles with mitigators.  The
  solutions from the guidance diagram perform similar to those from CASH on many datasets.
