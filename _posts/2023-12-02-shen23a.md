title: Computationally Efficient High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization via Variable
  Selection
openreview: QXKWSM0rFCK1
abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a widely-used method for the global optimization
  of black-box functions. While BO has been successfully applied to many scenarios,
  scaling BO algorithms to high-dimensional domains remains a challenge. Optimizing
  such functions by vanilla BO is extremely time-consuming. Alternative strategies
  for high-dimensional BO that are based on the idea of embedding the high-dimensional
  space to one with low dimensions are sensitive to the choice of the embedding dimension,
  which needs to be pre-specified. We develop a new computationally efficient high-dimensional
  BO method that leverages variable selection. We analyze the computational complexity
  of our algorithm and demonstrate its efficacy on several synthetic and real problems
  through empirical evaluations.
