title: Learning Debuggable Models Through Multi-Objective NAS
openreview: AwL9ZZOPVlN
abstract: Monumental advances in deep learning have led to unprecedented achievements
  across various domains. While the performance of deep neural networks is indubitable,
  the architectural design and interpretability of such models are nontrivial. Research
  has been introduced to automate the design of neural network architectures through
  neural architecture search (NAS). Recent progress has made these methods more pragmatic
  by exploiting distributed computation and novel optimization algorithms. However,
  there is little work in optimizing architectures for interpretability. To this end,
  we propose a multi-objective distributed NAS framework that optimizes for both task
  performance and ”introspectability,” a surrogate metric for the debuggability of
  a model. We leverage the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and explainable
  AI (XAI) techniques to reward architectures that can be better comprehended by domain
  experts. The framework is evaluated on several image classification datasets. We
  demonstrate that jointly optimizing for task error and introspectability leads to
  more disentangled and debuggable architectures that perform within tolerable error.
