title: AutoRL Hyperparameter Landscapes
openreview: Ec09TcV_HKq
abstract: Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown to be capable of producing
  impressive results, its use is limited by the impact of its hyperparameters on performance.
  This often makes it difficult to achieve good results in practice. Automated RL
  (AutoRL) addresses this difficulty, yet little is known about the dynamics of the
  hyperparameter landscapes that hyperparameter optimization (HPO) methods traverse
  in search of optimal configurations. In view of existing AutoRL approaches dynamically
  adjusting hyperparameter configurations, we propose an approach to build and analyze
  these hyperparameter landscapes not just for one point in time but at multiple points
  in time throughout training. Addressing an important open question on the legitimacy
  of such dynamic AutoRL approaches, we provide thorough empirical evidence that the
  hyperparameter landscapes strongly vary over time across representative algorithms
  from RL literature (DQN, PPO and SAC) in different kinds of environments (Cartpole,
  Bipedal Walker and Hopper). This supports the theory that hyperparameters should
  be dynamically adjusted during training and shows the potential for more insights
  on AutoRL problems that can be gained through landscape analysis. Our code can be
  found at \url{https://anon-github.automl.cc/r/autorl_landscape-F04D}.
