title: "“No Free Lunch” in Neural Architectures? A Joint Analysis of Expressivity,
  Convergence, and Generalization"
openreview: EMys3eIDJ2
abstract: 'The prosperity of deep learning and automated machine learning (AutoML)
  is largely rooted in the development of novel neural networks – but what defines
  and controls the “goodness” of networks in an architecture space? Test accuracy,
  a golden standard in AutoML, is closely related to three aspects: (1) expressivity
  (how complicated functions a network can approximate over the training data); (2)
  convergence (how fast the network can reach low training error under gradient descent);
  (3) generalization (whether a trained network can be generalized from the training
  data to unseen samples with low test error). However, most previous theory papers
  focus on fixed model structures, largely ignoring sophisticated networks used in
  practice. To facilitate the interpretation and understanding of the architecture
  design by AutoML, we target connecting a bigger picture: how does the architecture
  jointly impact its expressivity, convergence, and generalization? We demonstrate
  the “no free lunch” behavior in networks from an architecture space: given a fixed
  budget on the number of parameters, there does not exist a single architecture that
  is optimal in all three aspects. In other words, separately optimizing expressivity,
  convergence, and generalization will achieve different networks in the architecture
  space. Our analysis can explain a wide range of observations in AutoML. Experiments
  on popular benchmarks confirm our theoretical analysis. Our codes are attached in
  the supplement.'
