title: Efficient Multi-stage Inference on Tabular Data
openreview: lRFxsSgeYdE
abstract: Many ML applications and products train on medium amounts of input data
  but get bottlenecked in real-time inference. When implementing ML systems, conventional
  wisdom favors segregating ML code into services queried by product code via Remote
  Procedure Call (RPC) APIs. This approach clarifies the overall software architecture
  and simplifies product code by abstracting away ML internals. However, the separation
  adds network latency and entails additional CPU overhead. Hence, we simplify inference
  algorithms and embed them into the product code to reduce network communication.
  For public data sets and a high-performance real-time platform that deals with tabular
  data, we show that over half of the inputs are often amenable to such optimization,
  while the remainder can be handled by the original model. By applying our optimization
  with AutoML to both training and inference, we reduce inference latency by 1.3x,
  CPU resources by 30%, and network communication between application front-end and
  ML back-end by about 50% for a commercial end-to-end ML platform that serves millions
  of real-time decisions per second. The crucial role of AutoML is in configuring
  first-stage inference and balancing the two stages.
