title: 'MA-BBOB: Many-Affine Combinations of BBOB Functions for Evaluating AutoML
  Approaches in Noiseless Numerical Black-Box Optimization Contexts'
openreview: uN70Dum6pC2
abstract: Extending a recent suggestion to generate new instances for numerical black-box
  optimization benchmarking by interpolating pairs of the well-established BBOB functions
  from the COmparing COntinuous Optimizers (COCO) platform, we propose in this work
  a further generalization that allows multiple affine combinations of the original
  instances and arbitrarily chosen locations of the global optima.   We demonstrate
  that the MA-BBOB generator can help fill the instance space, while overall patterns
  in algorithm performance are preserved. By combining the landscape features of the
  problems with the performance data, we pose the question of whether these features
  are as useful for algorithm selection as previous studies have implied.  MA-BBOB
  is built on the publicly available IOHprofiler platform, which facilitates standardized
  experimentation routines, provides access to the interactive IOHanalyzer module
  for performance analysis and visualization, and enables comparisons with the rich
  and growing data collection available for the (MA-)BBOB functions.
