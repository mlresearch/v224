title: 'Multi-Predict: Few Shot Predictors For Efficient Neural Architecture Search'
openreview: 14U6uzrh-wr
abstract: Many hardware-aware neural architecture search (NAS) methods have been developed
  to optimize the topology of neural networks (NN) with the joint objectives of higher
  accuracy and lower latency. Recently, both accuracy and latency predictors have
  been used in NAS with great success, achieving high sample efficiency and accurate
  modeling of hardware (HW) device latency respectively. However, a new accuracy predictor
  needs to be trained for every new NAS search space or NN task, and a new latency
  predictor needs to be additionally trained for every new HW device. In this paper,
  we explore methods to enable multi-task, multi-search-space, and multi-HW adaptation
  of accuracy and latency predictors to reduce the cost of NAS.  We introduce a novel
  search-space independent NN encoding based on zero-cost proxies that achieves sample-efficient
  prediction on multiple tasks and NAS search spaces, improving the end-to-end sample
  efficiency of latency and accuracy predictors by over an order of magnitude in multiple
  scenarios. For example, our NN encoding enables multi-search-space transfer of latency
  predictors from NASBench-201 to FBNet (and vice-versa) in under 85 HW measurements,
  a 400${\times}$ improvement in sample efficiency compared to a recent meta-learning
  approach.  Our method also improves the total sample efficiency of accuracy predictors
  by over an order of magnitude. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
  method for multi-search-space and multi-task accuracy prediction on 28 NAS search
  spaces and tasks.
