  abstract   = {Many state-of-the-art automated machine learning (AutoML) systems use greedy ensemble selection (GES) by Caruana et al. (2004) to ensemble models found during model selection post hoc. Thereby, boosting predictive performance and likely following Auto-Sklearn 1's insight that alternatives, like stacking or gradient-free numerical optimization, overfit. Overfitting in Auto-Sklearn 1 is much more likely than in other AutoML systems because it uses only low-quality validation data for post hoc ensembling. Therefore, we were motivated to analyze whether Auto-Sklearn 1's insight holds true for systems with higher-quality validation data. Consequently, we compared the performance of covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES), state-of-the-art gradient-free numerical optimization, to GES on the 71 classification datasets from the AutoML benchmark for AutoGluon. We found that Auto-Sklearn's insight depends on the chosen metric. For the metric ROC AUC, CMA-ES overfits drastically and is outperformed by GES -- statistically significantly for multi-class classification. For the metric balanced accuracy, CMA-ES does not overfit and outperforms GES significantly. Motivated by the successful application of CMA-ES for balanced accuracy, we explored methods to stop CMA-ES from overfitting for ROC AUC. We propose a method to normalize the weights produced by CMA-ES, inspired by GES, that avoids overfitting for CMA-ES and makes CMA-ES perform better than or similar to GES for ROC AUC.}

  abstract   = {Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) methods can determine well-performing hyperparameter configurations efficiently but often lack insights and transparency. We propose to apply symbolic regression to meta-data collected with Bayesian optimization (BO) during HPO. In contrast to prior approaches explaining the effects of hyperparameters on model performance, symbolic regression allows for obtaining explicit formulas quantifying the relation between hyperparameter values and model performance. Overall, our approach aims to make the HPO process more explainable and human-centered, addressing the needs of multiple user groups: First, providing insights into the HPO process can support data scientists and machine learning practitioners in their decisions when using and interacting with HPO tools. Second, obtaining explicit formulas and inspecting their properties could help researchers understand the HPO loss landscape better. In an experimental evaluation, we find that naively applying symbolic regression directly to meta-data collected during HPO is affected by the sampling bias introduced by BO. However, the true underlying loss landscape can be approximated by fitting the symbolic regression on the surrogate model trained during BO. By penalizing longer formulas, symbolic regression furthermore allows the user to decide how to balance the accuracy and explainability of the resulting formulas.}

However, few methods have been explored to estimate the relative rankings of candidates, which can be more robust to noise and have better practicality than absolute function responses, especially when the function responses are intractable but preferences can be acquired. To this end, we propose a novel ranking-based surrogate model based on the Poisson process and introduce an efficient BO framework, namely Poisson Process Bayesian Optimization (PoPBO). Two tailored acquisition functions are further derived from classic LCB and EI to accommodate it. Compared to the classic GP-BO method, our PoPBO has lower computation costs and better robustness to noise, which is verified by abundant experiments. The results on both simulated and real-world benchmarks, including hyperparameter optimization (HPO) and neural architecture search (NAS), show the effectiveness of PoPBO.}

  abstract   = {Distribution shifts are all too common in real-world applications of machine learning. Domain adaptation (DA) aims to address this by providing various frameworks for adapting models to the deployment data without using labels. However, the domain shift scenario raises a second more subtle challenge: the difficulty of performing hyperparameter optimisation (HPO) for these adaptation algorithms without access to a labelled validation set. The unclear validation protocol for DA has led to bad practices in the literature, such as performing HPO using the target test labels when, in real-world scenarios, they are not available. This has resulted in over-optimism about DA research progress compared to reality. In this paper, we analyse the state of DA when using good evaluation practice, by benchmarking a suite of candidate validation criteria and using them to assess popular adaptation algorithms. We show that there are challenges across all three branches of domain adaptation methodology including Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA), and Test Time Adaptation (TTA). While the results show that realistically achievable performance is often worse than expected, they also show that using proper validation splits is beneficial, as well as showing that some previously unexplored validation metrics provide the best options to date. Altogether, our improved practices covering data, training, validation and hyperparameter optimisation form a new rigorous pipeline to improve benchmarking, and hence research progress, within this important field going forward.}

However, X-ray operators are often overwhelmed by the sheer amount of potential threats to assess; thus, current computer vision-aided systems are designed to alleviate these workloads. In this study, we focus on a key, unresolved challenge for developing such automatic X-ray screening systems: the direct application of existing avant garde computer vision approaches does not necessarily yield satisfactory results in the X-ray medium, hindering the effectiveness of current screening systems. To overcome this drawback, we propose a novel automated machine learning (AutoML) multi-objective approach for neural architecture search (NAS) for concealed weapon detection (MEOW). We benchmark MEOW with the state-of-the-art in two comprehensive scenarios in threat identification: SIXray (a popular, massive X-ray dataset) and Residuals (a proprietary, unpublished dataset provided by our industry partners). MEOW consist of the coalescence of two new components: First, we design a heuristic technique to strongly reduce the high computational cost of neuroevolutionary search while preserving a high performance such that it can be effectively used in real-time industrial settings. Second, we devise a novel ensemble approach for combining multiple discovered architectures simultaneously. Leveraging these two characteristics, MEOW outperforms the state-of-the-art while keeping the NAS overhead to a minimum. More broadly, our results suggest that AutoML has a strong potential for security applications.}

Unfortunately, our understanding of how to select suitable components for a problem at hand is very limited. In this work, we focus on the definition of the AF, whose main purpose is to balance the trade-off between exploring regions with high uncertainty and those with high promise for good solutions. We propose Self-Adjusting Weighted Expected Improvement (SAWEI), where we let the exploration-exploitation trade-off self-adjust in a data-driven manner, based on a convergence criterion for BO. On the noise-free black-box BBOB functions of the COCO benchmarking platform, our method exhibits a favorable any-time performance compared to handcrafted baselines and serves as a robust default choice for any problem structure. The suitability of our method also transfers to HPOBench. With SAWEI, we are a step closer to on-the-fly, data-driven, and robust BO designs that automatically adjust their sampling behavior to the problem at hand.}

We demonstrate that the MA-BBOB generator can help fill the instance space, while overall patterns in algorithm performance are preserved. By combining the landscape features of the problems with the performance data, we pose the question of whether these features are as useful for algorithm selection as previous studies have implied.

To fully understand this problem we analyse the performance of models independently trained with each pooling configurations on CIFAR10, using a ResNet20 network and show that the position of the downsampling layers can highly influence the performance of a network and predefined downsampling configurations are not optimal. Network Architecture Search (NAS) might be used to optimize downsampling configurations as an hyperparameter. However, we find that common one-shot NAS based on a single SuperNet do not work for this problem. We argue that this is because a SuperNet trained for finding the optimal pooling configuration fully shares its parameters among all pooling configurations. This makes its training hard because learning some configurations can harm the performance of others. Therefore, we propose a balanced mixture of SuperNets that automatically associates pooling configurations to different weight models and helps to reduce the weight-sharing and interinfluence of pooling configurations on the SuperNet parameters. We evaluate our proposed approach on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, as well as Food101, and show that in all cases our model outperforms other approaches and improves over the default pooling configurations.}

In this work, we introduce two novel population-based ensemble selection methods, QO-ES and QDO-ES, and compare them to GES. While QO-ES optimises solely for predictive performance, QDO-ES also considers the diversity of ensembles within the population, maintaining a diverse set of well-performing ensembles during optimisation based on ideas of quality diversity optimisation. The methods are evaluated using 71 classification datasets from the AutoML benchmark, demonstrating that QO-ES and QDO-ES often outrank GES, albeit only statistically significant on validation data. Our results further suggest that diversity can be beneficial for post hoc ensembling but also increases the risk of overfitting.}

Selecting the portfolio is a non-trivial task that requires balancing the trade-off between the higher flexibility of large portfolios with the increased complexity of the AAS task. In practice, probably the most common way to choose the algorithms for the portfolio is a greedy selection of the algorithms that perform well in some reference tasks of interest. We set out in this work to investigate alternative, data-driven portfolio selection techniques. Our proposed method creates algorithm behavior meta-representations, constructs a graph from a set of algorithms based on their meta-representation similarity, and applies a graph algorithm to select a final portfolio of diverse, representative, and non-redundant algorithms. We evaluate two distinct meta-representation techniques (SHAP and performance2vec) for selecting complementary portfolios from a total of 324 different variants of CMA-ES for the task of optimizing the BBOB single-objective problems in dimensionalities 5 and 30 with different cut-off budgets. We test two types of portfolios: one related to overall algorithm behavior and the `personalized' one (related to algorithm behavior per each problem separately). We observe that the approach built on the performance2vec-based representations favors small portfolios with negligible error in the AAS task relative to the virtual best solver from the selected portfolio, whereas the portfolios built from the SHAP-based representations gain from higher flexibility at the cost of decreased performance of the AAS. Across most considered scenarios, personalized portfolios yield comparable or slightly better performance than the classical greedy approach. They outperform the full portfolio in all scenarios.}

  abstract   = {The field of NAS has been significantly benefiting from the increased availability of parallel compute resources, as optimization algorithms typically require sampling and evaluating hundreds of model configurations. Consequently, to make use of these resources, the most commonly used early stopping-based NAS methods are suitable for running multiple trials in parallel. At the same time, also the training time of single model configurations can be reduced, e.g., by employing data-parallel training using multiple GPUs.   This paper investigates the optimal allocation of a fixed amount of parallel workers for conducting NAS. In practice, users have to decide if the computational resources are primarily used to assign more workers to the training of individual trials or to increase the number of trials executed in parallel. The first option accelerates the speed of the individual trials (exploitation) but reduces the parallelism of the NAS loop, whereas for the second option, the runtime of the trials is longer but a larger number of simultaneously processed trials in the NAS loop is achieved (exploration).   Our study encompasses both large- and small-scale scenarios, including tuning models in parallel on a single GPU, with data-parallel training on up to 16 GPUs, and measuring the scalability of NAS on up to 64 GPUs. Our empirical results using the HyperBand, Asynchronous Successive Halving, and Bayesian Optimization HyperBand methods offer valuable insights for users seeking to run NAS on both small and large computational budgets. By selecting the appropriate number of parallel evaluations, the NAS process can be accelerated by factors of ${\approx}$2--5 while preserving the test set accuracy compared to non-optimal resource allocations.}

In view of existing AutoRL approaches dynamically adjusting hyperparameter configurations, we propose an approach to build and analyze these hyperparameter landscapes not just for one point in time but at multiple points in time throughout training. Addressing an important open question on the legitimacy of such dynamic AutoRL approaches, we provide thorough empirical evidence that the hyperparameter landscapes strongly vary over time across representative algorithms from RL literature (DQN, PPO and SAC) in different kinds of environments (Cartpole, Bipedal Walker and Hopper). This supports the theory that hyperparameters should be dynamically adjusted during training and shows the potential for more insights on AutoRL problems that can be gained through landscape analysis.

  abstract   = {The prosperity of deep learning and automated machine learning (AutoML) is largely rooted in the development of novel neural networks -- but what defines and controls the ``goodness'' of networks in an architecture space? Test accuracy, a golden standard in AutoML, is closely related to three aspects: (1) expressivity (how complicated functions a network can approximate over the training data); (2) convergence (how fast the network can reach low training error under gradient descent); (3) generalization (whether a trained network can be generalized from the training data to unseen samples with low test error). However, most previous theory papers focus on fixed model structures, largely ignoring sophisticated networks used in practice. To facilitate the interpretation and understanding of the architecture design by AutoML, we target connecting a bigger picture: how does the architecture jointly impact its expressivity, convergence, and generalization? We demonstrate the ``no free lunch'' behavior in networks from an architecture space: given a fixed budget on the number of parameters, there does not exist a single architecture that is optimal in all three aspects. In other words, separately optimizing expressivity, convergence, and generalization will achieve different networks in the architecture space. Our analysis can explain a wide range of observations in AutoML. Experiments on popular benchmarks confirm our theoretical analysis. Our codes are attached in the supplement.}

Our analyses have shown that the accuracy drop can additionally be attributed to (i) Using ReLU as the default choice for activation functions unanimously, and (ii) Fine-tuning SNNs with the same hyperparameters as dense counterparts. Thus, we focus on learning a novel way to tune activation functions for sparse networks and combining these with a separate hyperparameter optimization (HPO) regime for sparse networks.

To reduce the search cost, recently proposed zero-cost proxies are utilized to efficiently predict the performance of an architecture. However, while many new proxies have been proposed in recent years, relatively little attention has been dedicated to pushing our understanding of the existing ones, with their mutual effects on each other being a particularly -- but not entirely -- overlooked topic. Contrary to that trend, in our work, we argue that it is worth revisiting and analysing the existing proxies in order to further push the boundaries of zero-cost NAS. Towards that goal, we propose to view the existing proxies through a common lens of network compressibility, trainability, and expressivity, as discussed in pruning literature. Notably, doing so allows us to build a better understanding of the high-level relationship between different proxies as well as refine some of them into their more informative variants. We leverage these insights to design a novel saliency and metric aggregation method informed by compressibility, orthogonality and network topology. We show that our proposed methods are simple but powerful and yield some state-of-the-art results across popular NAS benchmarks.}

Current Machine Learning (ML) workflows emphasize the vertical scaling of large models with paradigms such as `data-parallelism' or `model-parallelism'. As a consequence, there is a lack of methods for horizontal scaling of multiple experimental trials. Horizontal scaling is labor intensive when different tools are used for different experiment stages, such as for hyper-parameter optimization, distributed execution, or the consolidation of artifacts. We identify that errors in earlier stages of experimentation propagate to the analysis. Based on our observations, experimental results, and the current literature, we provide recommendations on best practices to prevent errors. To reduce the effort required to perform an accurate analysis and address common errors when scaling the execution of multiple experiments, we introduce ABLATOR. Our framework uses a stateful experiment design paradigm that provides experiment persistence and is robust to errors. Our actionable analysis artifacts are automatically produced by the experiment state and reduce the time to evaluate a hypothesis.

  abstract   = {We present AlphaD3M, an open-source Python library that supports a wide range of machine learning tasks over different data types. We discuss the challenges involved in supporting multiple tasks and how AlphaD3M addresses them by combining deep reinforcement learning and meta-learning to effectively construct pipelines over a large collection of primitives. To better integrate the use of AutoML within the data science lifecycle, we have built an ecosystem of tools around AlphaD3M that support user-in-the loop tasks, including the selection of suitable pipelines and the development of solutions for complex systems. We present use cases that demonstrate some of these features. We report the results of detailed experimental evaluations which show that AlphaD3M is effective and derives high-quality pipelines for a diverse set of problems with performance that is comparable or superior to state-of-the-art AutoML systems.}

  openreview = {14U6uzrh-wr},
  abstract   = {Many hardware-aware neural architecture search (NAS) methods have been developed to optimize the topology of neural networks (NN) with the joint objectives of higher accuracy and lower latency. Recently, both accuracy and latency predictors have been used in NAS with great success, achieving high sample efficiency and accurate modeling of hardware (HW) device latency respectively. However, a new accuracy predictor needs to be trained for every new NAS search space or NN task, and a new latency predictor needs to be additionally trained for every new HW device. In this paper, we explore methods to enable multi-task, multi-search-space, and multi-HW adaptation of accuracy and latency predictors to reduce the cost of NAS.  We introduce a novel search-space independent NN encoding based on zero-cost proxies that achieves sample-efficient prediction on multiple tasks and NAS search spaces, improving the end-to-end sample efficiency of latency and accuracy predictors by over an order of magnitude in multiple scenarios. For example, our NN encoding enables multi-search-space transfer of latency predictors from NASBench-201 to FBNet (and vice-versa) in under 85 HW measurements, a 400${\times}$ improvement in sample efficiency compared to a recent meta-learning approach.  Our method also improves the total sample efficiency of accuracy predictors by over an order of magnitude. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for multi-search-space and multi-task accuracy prediction on 28 NAS search spaces and tasks.}

  author     = {Navarro, Jose Manuel and Huet, Alexis and Rossi, Dario},
  pages      = {24/1--19},
  openreview = {7cUV9K3ns9Q},
  abstract   = {Unsupervised model recommendation for anomaly detection is a recent discipline for which there is no existing work that focuses on multivariate time series data. This paper studies that problem under real-world restrictions, most notably: (i) a limited time to issue a recommendation, which renders existing methods based around the testing of a large pool of models unusable;  (ii) the need for generalization to previously unseen data sources, which is seldom factored in the experimental evaluation.  We turn to meta-learning and propose Hydra, the first meta-recommender for anomaly detection in literature that we especially analyze in the context of multivariate times series. We conduct our experiments using 94  public datasets from 4 different data sources. Our ablation study testifies that our meta-recommender achieves a higher performance than the current state of the art, including in difficult scenarios in which data similarity is minimal: our proposal is able to recommend a model in the top 10\% (13\%) of the algorithmic pool for known (unseen) sources of data.}
